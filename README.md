<!-- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). -->

## Tech Plus

Tech Plus is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app. It utilizes modern web development tools, including TailwindCSS and PostCSS and react-icons, to deliver a responsive and dynamic user experience.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project locally:

# Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v16 or later recommended)
- npm or yarn for package management

# Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>

cd tech-plus-tailwind

```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

# Running the Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize.
